why isn’t there just a proof of stake blockchain with a 10 minute block time 

that would be a fun vibe to participate in 

save energy but have a lot of unpredictable more randomizable asynchronous group work like a group society game where the goal is to maximize the squad 

why isn’t there like a dinner table i can order with 12 chairs where every hour of the clock 1 of my 11 homies and myself Da Vinci Last Supper Style get to block freestyle 

but in between people can be working on their next cyphers 

but maybe those 12 freestylers are Agents themselves who similar to RSS feeds are subscribed to feeds yet cyclically can be subscribed to other agents

so like a person could have one of their genie TV stations be their first cousin,  another could be their rich uncle,  their 4th could be their favorite designer,  7th could be management media team of favorite model ,  8th could be Spacebook Combinator ,  2nd could be philosopher dumbledore dev trivia farmschool sciencecamp
